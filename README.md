# a11y-dropdown
An accessible dropdown navigation for websites.

## Accessibility support
This dropdown menu works for mouse and keyboard input devices. I'm working on a touch-friendly update.

## WordPress
It was built around the output HTML that WordPress uses in its `wp_nav()` function, but can be modified easily to suit other dropdown navigation systems.

It currently only goes one level deep. I've intentionally excluded sub-sub menus from showing up as I think sites with deep navigation can be confusing. Keep it simple.

## Changelog
* v0.1 26 May 2016 First commit includes dropdown script and basic styles.

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute. Fork and PR.
